# ThermML User Stories

This directory hosts user stories that allow us to identify, analyse, and improve our understanding of how ThermML data files will be read, created, modified, and used.
We use user stories rather than use cases here, because they are more light-weight (see this post on [user stories vs. use cases](https://uxcam.com/blog/user-stories-vs-use-cases/)).
The combination of user stories with requirement analysis should provide the best of both world.
We will be able to interact with people unfamiliar with the technical details of data languages through user stories, and use more formal requirements to guide more technical people and developers.
